# FullSatckApp
# vue3-ExPress-app
## About
Application is built using node.js - v20.10.0, express.js, graph db, d3.js and vue.js3 framework.
We used Jest for testing purpose. We used vue.js over other frameworks because of its complete easy to use ecosystem, fast compilation, easy learning curve and its easy to use syntax which gives upper hand over other frameworks in writing code faster.Application is about showing hierarchy data by fetching result from express server using graph db and in front end we query the data using graph ql and show it on d3.js cahrt.
